This example is intended to be a starting point for new development where a fuller set of kernel features and debug capabilities are enabled.

\subsection*{Peripherals Exercised}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Board\+\_\+\+L\+E\+D0} -\/ Indicates that the board was initialized within {\ttfamily main()}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Example Usage}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The example lights {\ttfamily Board\+\_\+\+L\+E\+D0} as part of the initialization in {\ttfamily main()}. Then a heart\+Beat task toggles the L\+ED at a rate determined by the {\ttfamily arg0} parameter for the constructed \mbox{\hyperlink{struct_task}{Task}} instance in the .c file.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Application Design Details}

This examples is the same as the Empty\+\_\+\+Minimal example except many development and debug features are enabled. For example\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Kernel Idle task
\item Stack overflow checking
\item Logs or Asserts are enabled
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{quote}
The R\+OM is being used in this example. This is controlled by the following lines in the $\ast$.cfg$\ast$ file\+: \end{quote}


\begin{quote}

\begin{DoxyCode}
</blockquote>
    var ROM = xdc.useModule('ti.sysbios.rom.ROM');
    if (Program.cpu.deviceName.match(/CC26/)) \{
        ROM.romName = ROM.CC2650;
    \}
    else if (Program.cpu.deviceName.match(/CC13/)) \{
        ROM.romName = ROM.CC1350;
    \}
\end{DoxyCode}


\begin{quote}
Since the kernel in the R\+OM is being used, there is no logging or assert \end{quote}
checking done by the kernel.

\begin{quote}
For I\+AR users using any Sensor\+Tag(\+S\+T\+K) Board, the X\+D\+S110 debugger must be \end{quote}
selected with the 4-\/wire J\+T\+AG connection within your projects\textquotesingle{} debugger configuration.
